            <h2>Blog Post #1: The Week of August 24th</h2>
            <p>This week I voted for which project I'd like to work on Project Management. I also had coversations regarding the viability of electric car batteries and the prospect drilling for oil in a prviously protected refuge. Aside from that, I worked on general homework for Server-Side Databases and Operations Research.</p>
