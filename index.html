        <h2>Blog Post #1: The Week of August 24th</h2>
        <p>
            This week I voted for which project I'd like to work on Project Management. I also had coversations regarding the
            viability of electric car batteries and the prospect drilling for oil in a prviously protected refuge. Aside from that,
            I worked on general homework for Server-Side Databases and Operations Research. Now I'm working on this site.

            Below is a portion of my discussion post:

            "The primary difference between static and dynamic website is that static webpages have all their content fixed such that every user see the same content while dynamic sites allow users to interact with the site and view differing content. Static sites are coded entirely in hard-coded HTML while dynamic sites can make use of databases and many different programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Static sites are far easier to work with due to the straight-forward HTML approach. Static sites are also faster to load since no time needs to be taken to process a request. Static sites can also be cheaper to host since they do not take time on the server to process requests. Unfortunately, static sites are limited since they cannot provide users the opportunity to interact by making those requests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamic sites are much more flexible since they can make use of many coding languages to process requests and return useful info to the user. This power makes dynamic sites the go-to option for many large businesses. Dynamic sites are far more complicated to work with and are prone to bugs which can hinder user experience. These sites are slower than static sites since they must process requests. This can also make them more expensive to host.
        </p>
        <p>
            Static sites can be good for documentation and blogging since the HTML files can simply be updated to provide updates for users (since the users themselves will not be posting to the site).
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamic sites are the go-to option for e-commerce since there needs to be a lot of back-end services provided to make transactions happen in a secure and effective way."
        </p>
        <p>
            I have implemented a static approch to this site since I, as the author, am the only one who will be posting to this site. I also don't need viewers to indentify themselves or view personalized content.
