        <h2>Blog Post #1: The Week of August 24th</h2>
        <p>
            This week I voted for which project I'd like to work on Project Management. I also had coversations regarding the
            viability of electric car batteries and the prospect drilling for oil in a prviously protected refuge. Aside from that,
            I worked on general homework for Server-Side Databases and Operations Research. Now I'm working on this site.
