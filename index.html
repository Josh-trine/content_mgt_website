        <h2>Blog Post #1: The Week of August 24th</h2>
        <p>
            This week I voted for which project I'd like to work on Project Management. I also had coversations regarding the
            viability of electric car batteries and the prospect drilling for oil in a prviously protected refuge. Aside from that,
            I worked on general homework for Server-Side Databases and Operations Research. Now I'm working on this site.

        <h2>Blog Post #2: The Week of August 31st</h2>
        <p>
            I have implemented a static approch to this site since I, as the author, am the only one who will be posting to this site. I also don't need viewers to indentify themselves or view personalized content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a portion of my discussion post:
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight:200;">
            "The primary difference between static and dynamic website is that static webpages have all their content fixed such that every user see the same content while dynamic sites allow users to interact with the site and view differing content. Static sites are coded entirely in hard-coded HTML while dynamic sites can make use of databases and many different programming languages.
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight:200;">
            Static sites are far easier to work with due to the straight-forward HTML approach. Static sites are also faster to load since no time needs to be taken to process a request. Static sites can also be cheaper to host since they do not take time on the server to process requests. Unfortunately, static sites are limited since they cannot provide users the opportunity to interact by making those requests.
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight:200;">
            Dynamic sites are much more flexible since they can make use of many coding languages to process requests and return useful info to the user. This power makes dynamic sites the go-to option for many large businesses. Dynamic sites are far more complicated to work with and are prone to bugs which can hinder user experience. These sites are slower than static sites since they must process requests. This can also make them more expensive to host.
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight:200;">
            Static sites can be good for documentation and blogging since the HTML files can simply be updated to provide updates for users (since the users themselves will not be posting to the site).
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight:200;">
            Dynamic sites are the go-to option for e-commerce since there needs to be a lot of back-end services provided to make transactions happen in a secure and effective way."

        <h2>Blog Post #3: The History of Content Management</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many aspects to consider when discussing how content management has changed over the years. The aspects which I will be discussing in today&rsquo;s blogpost are personalization, Advanced websites, multiple publications, e-commerce, knowledge management, and online communities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first aspect I will be talking about is personalization. Personalization has had a major impact on today&rsquo;s content management practices. but before we get ahead of ourselves, let's talk about what it is. Personalization, as defined by Bob Boiko in the Content Management Bible, is &ldquo;delivering the most appropriate content to a person inside a standard framework&rdquo;. This essentially means that the site will follow a basic structure unique to that site while providing content that matches what the viewer wants to or expects to see. This aspect of content management has helped with keeping the viewers engaged which is important for today&rsquo;s content. Websites are trying harder all the time to keep their viewer more engaged for many reasons and personalization in one of the most important pieces in driving engagement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next aspect I&rsquo;d like to discuss is the concept of advanced websites. The idea of advance websites is closely tied to the principles of a well-functioning content management system. That is- the website is designed intelligently such that development goes smoothly and has a high degree of consistency. Advanced sites usually have to deal with content sharing between pages, changes in content and designs, a lot of different types of content, and they will typically have a lot of contributors as well as different methods of contribution. With all of these factors to keep track of an &ldquo;advanced website&rdquo; is one that is designed intelligently enough to manage all of these complicated matters. Without the concept of advanced websites, the sites we enjoy today would not be possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next aspect I will be talking about also ties closely to content management systems. This is the idea of multiple publications. This concept came about after publications that were previously print-only decided they also wanted to target audiences across the internet. Because of this, they needed to not only publish the print but also create web pages that users could visit. Without a well-functioning Content Management System, this process would nearly double the amount of time needed to publish these materials on both mediums. This was a very impactful moment in content management because it highlighted the need for a robust content management system to keep up with publications and reduce effort and cost. Ideally, this would allow for multiple simultaneous publications which greatly improve the availability to the would-be viewers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next aspect is e-commerce. This field of content management came about after web technology had matured enough to be able to handle dealing with people&rsquo;s money. Shortly after this everyone rushed to offer e-commerce on their sites. As they did so it quickly became apparent that a lot of work needed to be done from a user experience standpoint as it wasn&rsquo;t enough to simply offer products and exchange money. People wanted an interactive experience that allowed them to find products, see their carts, and know how much they were spending. This ties closely with both personalization and advanced sites due to the personal aspect and highly involved nature of e-commerce. This also forced developers to take a closer look at their legacy systems since they needed to have a high degree of integration. Overall e-commerce has had a massive impact on content management. You need not look further than Amazon.com.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I want to talk about knowledge management. Knowledge management is the process of creating, collecting, organizing, and making knowledge available. This process is quite important to many areas of business. Here, knowledge is content and we must thus find a way to create a knowledge management system. Since the concept of knowledge management and content management are so closely related, there is a lot that a content management system can do to assist in this process. Although knowledge management is not as big and flashy as e-commerce, personalization, or other aspects of content management, it is still a very valuable thing to keep track of in a business setting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last aspect I will be talking about in this blog post is the field of online communities. In recent years online communities have become core to today's view of content management with many sites now trying to create a sense of community in many sites. A major part of communities is the idea that each member has the ability to contribute to the site. This makes it clear that there is a need for a content management system since each contribution is essentially a publication of its own. Additionally, these community-based websites require a high degree of personalization, an aspect we discussed earlier. Not only that, but e-commerce also has its place in community sites since many times these sites are great for marketing. All o these aspects of online communities have really forced the field of content management to adapt and evolve with the times.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have discussed most of the important moments and aspects of content management, we can see that each piece is related and more times than not they are united by one principle- the need for a well-functioning Content Management System!</p>

        <h2>Blog Post #4: CMS and the Organization</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Content Management System is crucial to any organization that needs to manage and publish a large amount of content. When considering a CMS (Content Management System), you must keep in mind all of the stakeholders as well as the needs of your staff. Additionally, there are a lot of hurdles to consider when trying to create and manage a well-functioning CMS. I will attempt to address all of these important aspects in this week&rsquo;s blog post.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there are many, many stakeholders for a CMS, the major stakeholders can be organized into three main groups. These are the organizational sponsors, the projects team, and the audience (which is the final judge of your system)<sup>[1]</sup>. The organizational sponsors are the individuals that you need support from in order to have a successful project, even though they might not interact directly with the CMS. The projects team will be discussed in detail later in this post but for now, I&rsquo;ll just say that they are the ones that interact directly with the CMS, so they are deeply invested in the quality of the CMS. The last group, the audience, is concerned with the product that the CMS produces. For CMS to be considered well-functioning, all of these stakeholders must be satisfied.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed stakeholders, I want to expand on the projects team a little more. The project team is actually comprised of many smaller teams that must all interact in order to have a successful CMS. In general, an effective CMS will have the following: managers, business analysts, information architects, infrastructure staff, software developers, publications staff, content processing staff, and content creation staff. I will be generalizing these teams into four large groups: business units, editorial teams, marketing teams, and the IT group.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I want to detail the interactions that the four groups I mentioned earlier must have in order to have a successful CMS. The business units create the content and functionality that the CMS must deliver. This team will provide the content to the editorial teams that then unify the content so that the organization is publishing consistent, quality content. The marketing team must conduct an audience analysis and provide a unified message across all publications. The IT group is required to implement and maintain the CMS infrastructure across the organization. The IT group may also be responsible for creating functionality that is needed<sup>[1]</sup>. The marketing team must work closely with the editorial team so that a unified message can be produced constantly. The IT team must be successful in order to provide all other teams the infrastructure needed to be effective and consistent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned in the introduction to this blog post a CMS is not without its hurdles. the main hurdles as describe by Bob Boiko are: Who owns the system? What is our content model? How do we create general content? How do we automate publications? &nbsp;Will the CMS stifle creativity in our authors and publications? Don&rsquo;t we already have a mandate? How can we do this project when our team has no power?<sup>[1]</sup>. I will be focusing on successful content management and successful content usage so I will be narrowing down to three main hurdles of who owns the system, the automation of publications, and what the content model should be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first issue of system ownership should not be allowed to cause argument s among the teams. This is because regardless of who owns the system, each team must work cooperatively to solve issues that might be encountered. Any group that forms rivalries with another over this issue risk the failure of the CMS as a whole<sup>[1]</sup>. The next issue of automating publications is largely misunderstood. This is because outside of a CMS individuals are accustom to creating the publications themselves and only then to they tweak the publications to their liking. This can be resolved with the CMS approach which revolves around creating templates that will give rise to the publications<sup>[1]</sup>. The last hurdle I will be discussing in this post is the issue of the content model. This issue is of genuine concern as the process of creating a content scheme, or model is a very involved process. This process requires that many groups across the organization debate and compromise on a lot of issues to create a consistent content scheme that can be shared across the entire organization.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the stakeholders for the CMS are satisfied and you are able to overcome all of the hurdles that come with designing, implementing, and managing a CMS, then it can be very beneficial to an organization. A successful CMS can provide a consistent system for creating, editing, publishing, and managing content. Consistency is very important when dealing with large businesses and a necessity for any enterprise so it goes without saying that a CMS is essential in supporting many organizations.</p>
